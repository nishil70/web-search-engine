He works in machine learning and robotics, in particular his research focuses on making robots learn from people (apprenticeship learning), how to make robots learn through their own trial and error (reinforcement learning), and how to speed up skill acquisition through learning-to-learn (meta-learning).

Paul was drawn to robots from an early age because of the awe and wonder of watching your creation come to life in the real world and developed a deeper passion for the field when he recognized the empowerment that comes from creating something that can have real, tangible impact for good. In graduate school at UC Berkeley, Paul worked on how to design robots intelligently and wholistically such that the mechanisms, sensors, electronics, and software complement each other to create simple yet robust solutions to specific problems. This design mentality led to the technologies that launched Paul\u2019s first company, Dash Robotics, where he was a co-founder and CTO. Started during his Ph.D. and derived from his research, Dash Robotics focused on making low-cost, build-it-yourself, bio-inspired legged robots available to kids to promote STEM engagement. While moonlighting to help build and grow Dash Robotics, Paul was also a research engineer at SRI Robotics where he contributed to projects including lightweight wearable robotics, autonomous racing motorcycles, and dynamically-walking humanoid robots. Paul also helped push novel manipulator and arm designs at iRobot that are being used in products today. Of all the projects Paul takes on, he tries to keep his focus on making systems that are cutting-edge, yet practical and towards something deployable in a larger market.

Over the course of a management career that lasted 39 years, he won 49 major trophies, making him the most successful manager in the history of British football.<\/p>\n\n<p>He made his name with Aberdeen, who became the first club to consistently break the Old Firm dominance of the Scottish game, winning 9 domestic trophies over a 6 year period. But it was victory over Real Madrid in the European Cup-Winners Cup Final in 1983 that brought him to national attention.<\/p>\n\n<p>Following his move to Manchester United in 1986, he set about restructuring the club and his first trophy in 1990 opened the floodgates.

In the same year he released \"My Autobiography\"\u200b which became the UK's quickest selling non-fiction book since records began. This work was a follow-up to his first best-selling memoir, \"Managing My Life\", which appeared in 1999.<\/p>\n\n<p>His new book \u2018Leading\u2019, written with Sir Michael Moritz, details the key skills and philosophies he used to deliver success both on and off the field and will be released in September 2015.<\/p>","cbAvatar":"https:\/\/crunchbase-production-res.cloudinary.com\/image\/upload\/v1447886197\/fch0vdzg78dny7x125vq.jpg","company":"Manchester United Football Club Limited","featured":0,"name":"Sir Alex Ferguson","position":"Director, Football Board","links":{"crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/sir-alex-ferguson","twitter":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/furious_fergie","linkedin":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/siralexferguson"}},{"bio":"<p>Martha is  founder and executive chair of Doteveryone.org.uk.
