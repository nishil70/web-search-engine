It will let people opt in to creating a dating profile on Facebook. It will only be visible to non-friends who also opted into dating. Facebook will match you by a slew of preferences. And because it has more data on you than any other app, it could deliver more relevant matches. The feature will start testing later this year.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook explains that &#8220;potential matches will be recommended based on dating preferences, things in common, and mutual friends. They\u2019ll have the option to discover others with similar interests through their Groups or Events.&#8221; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/14\/facebook-matchmaker\/\">TechCrunch suggested that Facebook build a feature like this in February<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1631737 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/facebook-dating1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"369\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how Facebook dating will work:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Opt in to a create a profile with just your first name. Your profile won&#8217;t be visible to friends, users who aren&#8217;t on the dating feature, and it won&#8217;t show up in the News Feed.<\/li>\n<li>You&#8217;ll browse Events in your city and Groups that match your interests. You can select to &#8220;unlock&#8221; one for dating. You&#8217;ll then see the profiles of other dating users who&#8217;ve unlocked that surface.<\/li>\n<li>You can browse through people&#8217;s profiles that show off a few of their photos plus some basic information about them. You&#8217;ll be shown people based on mutual interests and friends, plus other data Facebook has on you.<\/li>\n<li>If you both are interested, you&#8217;ll be able to start a conversation with someone in a special inbox that&#8217;s separate from Messenger and WhatsApp. For safety, only text can be sent for now.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Tons of marriages start on Facebook already, so there&#8217;s a big opportunity for the company to build long-term relationship-focused matching &#8212; opposed to apps like Tinder that focus on quick hookups. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/match-stock-tank\/\">Investors clearly think Tinder is in danger<\/a>, considering shares of its parent company Match Group fell 17 percent after Facebook announced its entry into dating.<\/p>\n<p>Still, the question is whether Facebook has built enough barricades between its social network and new dating feature. Users might find it creepy to do it all in one app. And if they get burned by a bad experience either in the dating chat or offline, they could blame Facebook. Still, as Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox explained, dating was always a natural fit for Facebook thanks to its ubiquity, data and trusted platform for identity.<\/p>\n<p>At the very least, you&#8217;ll be a lot less likely to get catfished on FaceDate.<\/p>\n<p><em>We explored how this could work in a feature piece earlier this year:<\/em><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"H3UPfNj1L3\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/14\/facebook-matchmaker\/\">Facebook should actually be Tinder too<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/14\/facebook-matchmaker\/embed\/#?secret=H3UPfNj1L3\" data-secret=\"H3UPfNj1L3\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Facebook should actually be Tinder too&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/f8-2018-banner.png\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook is invading Tinder&#8217;s space with a new set of dating features.

href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> ended up with a pretty decent report for its second quarter, beating analyst expectations on most of its metrics \u2014 but it is making a huge move in terms of returning capital to investors.<\/p>\n<p>The company said it is announcing a new $100 billion buyback program and increasing its dividend by 16%. That means that Apple investors are going to get more of an opportunity to snap up the value the company has created over time as it&#8217;s continued to grow significantly. While Apple in the past several months a lot of the momentum that carried it to a market cap nearing $1 trillion, the company&#8217;s stock has still risen around 80% in the past two years. Not surprisingly, the stock today is soaring (by Apple standards) in extended trading, with shares rising nearly 5% after the report.<\/p>\n<p>Last quarter Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company expected to be &#8220;net cash neutral&#8221; over time, signaling that it might start returning more capital to shareholders through its dividend and share buyback programs. That&#8217;ll be important for the company, which thanks to the tax bill last year will be able to repatriate a significant amount of the cash it holds outside of the U.S. These kinds of returns are pretty common with larger companies that generate a ton of cash \u2014 Apple already had some buyback programs in place, for example \u2014 but investors have always dinged Apple for not deploying its massive pile of cash.<\/p>\n<p>This quarter, however, Apple&#8217;s pile of cash actually <em>fell<\/em>. Apple continued to add more and more cash to its reserves, though a significant amount of it was overseas. This quarter it fell to $267.2 billion, down $17.9 billion from the last quarter.\u00a0From August 2012 to March 2018, Apple has returned around $275 billion in capital to Wall Street. That included a collective $200 billion in share repurchases. Apple has had some of these programs in place, but this is still a substantial addition to its capital return plans.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the line was a pretty solid beat on expectations Apple&#8217;s services revenue continues to grow as it looks to create a steady additional revenue stream. All that&#8217;s important too, of course, but the big news here is the set of buybacks.\u00a0Here&#8217;s the bottom line:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q2 Revenue:<\/strong>\u00a0$61.1 billion, compared to analyst estimates of $60.86 billion. Apple projected between $60 billion and $62 billion. It&#8217;s an increase of 14% year-over-year.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q2 Earnings<\/strong>: $2.73 per share, compared to analyst estimates of $2.60 per share.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q2 iPhone shipments<\/strong>: 52.2 million units sold, compared to Wall Street estimates of 51.9 million iPhones sold.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q2 Greater China revenue<\/strong>: $13 billion, up 21% year-over-year.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q3 Gross Margin estimate<\/strong>: Between 38% and 38.5%<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q3 Revenue estimate<\/strong>: Between $51.5 billion and $53.5 billion<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q2 iPad shipments<\/strong>: 9.1 million units<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q2 Mac shipments<\/strong>: 4.1 million units<\/li>\n<li><strong>Q2 Services revenue<\/strong>: $9.2 billion, up 31% year-over-year<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631932\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apple-quarterly-revenue-1.png?w=550\" alt=\"\" width=\"550\" height=\"626\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That big capital return program is likely to keep investors happy for some time while it continues to sort out its new iPhone lineup. Last year, the company released the iPhone X \u2014 which was widely praised, but also carried a substantial $999 price tag for the cheapest model. Apple has worked to create programs to pay for those phones over time, but it&#8217;s still an extremely high ticket price. That&#8217;s especially true internationally, where consumers might not tolerate high prices for those phones. As a result, the reception on Wall Street was pretty muted, and Apple seems to have to figure out some other way to restart that iPhone growth engine.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631927\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apple-stock-chart.png?w=549\" alt=\"\" width=\"549\" height=\"582\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Toward the end of last year, it seemed like Apple was inching closer to being a company with a market cap over $1 trillion. That&#8217;s a completely symbolic number, but nonetheless would be a significant milestone for the iPhone maker that looks to figure out what a next-generation smartphone looks like. Apple&#8217;s stock has by no means been in a tailspin, but it hasn&#8217;t really done anything either as expectations start to drop a bit following the launch of the iPhone X.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple ended up with a pretty decent report for its second quarter, beating analyst expectations on most of its metrics \u2014 but it is making a huge move in terms of returning capital to investors.

Snapchat reached only 191 million daily active users, up from 187 million, with its growth rate sinking to 2.13 percent &#8212; its slowest ever, compared to 5.05 percent in Q4 and a disastrous 2.9 percent in Q3. It pulled in\u00a0$230.7 million in revenue with an adjusted EPS loss of $0.17. That&#8217;s compared to Wall Street&#8217;s estimates of $244.5 million in revenue and an adjusted EPS loss of $0.16.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"size-large wp-image-1631923 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/snapchat-dau-2018-q1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"373\" \/><\/p>\n<p>It seems that Snapchat&#8217;s sudden growth spurt last quarter was a fluke, with Snap adding just 1 million users in its core North American market this quarter. It&#8217;s actually worse than it looks. CEO Evan Spiegel wrote in his prepared remarks that compared to its 191 million users quarterly average, &#8220;our March average was lower, but still above our Q4 average.&#8221; The idea that Snapchat actually shrank last month should terrify investors.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat is going to have ongoing trouble significantly increasing its user count with over 300 million daily users on Instagram Stories, and 450 million on WhatsApp Status &#8212; both clones of Snapchat. Wall Street hates weak user growth, and Snap&#8217;s share price fell about 15 percent in after-hours trading to $12.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631969\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-1-54-20-pm.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"552\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Snap&#8217;s losses grew to $385.7 million, up from $350 million last quarter. That&#8217;s another spot Snap was hoping to improve with cost-cutting layoffs, but those were too little too late. COO Imran Khan warned that &#8220;as we think about our year-over-year revenue growth rates, we are planning for our Q2 growth rate to decelerate substantially from Q1 levels.&#8221; That&#8217;s another reason investors are bolting.<\/p>\n<p>One of the few bright spots of the earnings report was the reveal of Snap Pro For Busines and Creators. It&#8217;s an app for public figures and businesses to run their Snapchat presence. Khan wrote that the product will make it\u00a0&#8220;easier to manage a public profile, create and distribute content, understand audience insights, and ultimately, advertise with us.&#8221; Rollout is still very early, though.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"mYewRt9Tae\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-reredesign\/\">Snapchat scrambles to fix failed redesign, moves Stories to Discover<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-reredesign\/embed\/#?secret=mYewRt9Tae\" data-secret=\"mYewRt9Tae\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat scrambles to fix failed redesign, moves Stories to Discover&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Snap also saw an unprecedented decline in its average revenue per user in North America. It&#8217;s standard for the holiday Q4 to rake in more cash than the following Q1. But Snap&#8217;s ARPU in the US and Canada slipped to $2.10, down from $2.75 in Q4, but also down from $2.17 in Q3. That indicates serious problems monetizing that could be due to fewer Stories or Discover ad views during Q1.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our redesign created some headwinds in our revenue this quarter by disrupting user behavior and creating some apprehension among our advertising partners&#8221; Spiegel admitted. That&#8217;s why Snapchat is now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-reredesign\/\">rolling out a big re-redesign<\/a> that jams Stories into the Discover page, which still seems worse than the original design. What I think Snap needs is tabs for chronologically-sorted messages and relevancy-sorted Stories in the friends side of the app, and all professional content in the Discover section.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631925\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/snapchat-arpu-q1-2018.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"371\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Snapchat spent the year&#8217;s first quarter trying to capitalize on Facebook&#8217;s Cambridge Analytica scandal while <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/11\/29\/snapchat-redesign\/\">overhauling the design of its own app<\/a>. Initial app store reviews were <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/11\/snapchat-redesign-uninstall\/\">predominantly negative<\/a>, but <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/02\/27\/surfing-the-hate-wave\/\">first-time installs and its App Store rank increased<\/a>. Celebrity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-02-22\/snap-royalty-kylie-jenner-erased-a-billion-dollars-in-one-tweet\">backlash<\/a> and anecdotal declines in usage for some people have pushed Snap to waffle on the changes, in some cases <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/07\/snapchat-brings-back-chronological-stories-feed-for-some\/\">changing the app to work more like the old version<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631954\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/snapchat-user-growth-q1-2018.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"353\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Snap just launched version 2 of its Spectacles camera sunglasses, but we&#8217;ll have to wait until next quarter to see any revenue from that. The question will be whether Snapchat&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/cheddar.com\/videos\/exclusive-snap-plans-biggest-round-of-layoffs-yet-totaling-120-engineers\"> layoffs of over 120 staffers<\/a> will start to make a dent in its big losses, because it certainly didn&#8217;t show up this quarter.<\/p>\n<p>During the call, Spiegel said he&#8217;s hoping that separating creators from friends will help Snap build an audience for them so they make it the favored home for their content. But even if it improves creator discovery, it&#8217;s hard to compete with the sheer size of Instagram and WhatsApp. CFO Drew Volero meanwhile said that Snap is trying to get to break-even, but there&#8217;s no timeline for that\/ Producing $385 million more in revenue per quarter is going to be a massive challenge without significant user growth, especially with reduced headcount from layoffs.<\/p>\n<p>As I wrote early this year, &#8220;The popularity of Snapchat messaging amongst western teenagers means it won\u2019t disappear overnight. But it may be time for it and the world to face the fact that Snapchat could be a world-changing product without ever becoming a world-dominating business.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nZsVFYyVT2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/09\/the-ever-ending-story\/\">What is Snapchat, now that Story sharing has stopped growing?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/09\/the-ever-ending-story\/embed\/#?secret=nZsVFYyVT2\" data-secret=\"nZsVFYyVT2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;What is Snapchat, now that Story sharing has stopped growing?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Honestly, Snap is in serious trouble.

Meanwhile sites like Sci-Hub have worked to liberate the data held by paid journals, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/04\/29\/sci-hub-is-providing-science-publishers-with-their-napster-moment\/\">illegally of course<\/a>, and become indispensable in the process.<\/p>\n<p>The statement comes from Tom Dietterich at Oregon State University, founding president of the International Machine Learning Society.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Machine learning has been at the forefront of the movement for free and open access to research&#8230; We see no role for closed access or author-fee publication in the future of machine learning research and believe the adoption of this new journal as an outlet of record for the machine learning community would be a retrograde step,&#8221; it reads.<\/p>\n<p>The statement cites past opposition in the community to paid journals and the fact that all the major ones in existence charge nothing as well &#8220;The following list of researchers,&#8221; it continues, &#8220;hereby state that they will not submit to, review, or edit for this new journal.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>There are nearly 2,300 signatures from all over the world. Students, professors, researchers, architects, and engineers people the list; there are representatives of many major companies in the field: Google, Intel, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM; many of the world&#8217;s most august learning institutions can be found on it as well.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not that machine learning is fundamentally incompatible with paid access, Diettrich told me in an email; rather, the field has grown to prominence so recently that free and open-access journals have just been the better option from the start.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our research community has been fortunate to develop an expectation of free and open access to published research, but many other areas of science and mathematics are moving in the same direction,&#8221; he wrote.<\/p>\n<p>I asked if he thought Nature&#8217;s interest manifesting in this way indicated a healthy field. &#8220;It is a sign that Nature Publishing Group believes they can make money in this relatively young area of research,&#8221; he answered.<\/p>\n<p>But the pledge seems like a widely supported one, he concluded: &#8220;My impression is that we have excellent representation from all of the major research labs in universities and companies.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Nature may still draw papers because of its clout, but it looks like at least a significant number of researchers in this area will give it the cold shoulder. Are you among their number?

That functionality will be coming, however, as the team looks to bring 60fps desktop streaming to the Go.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, there is full cross-compatibility between the desktop and mobile versions of Bigscreen with this release. The experience will definitely feel a little different without a tracked headset and controllers, but Oculus Go users will be able to dive in and chat with Vive, Rift and Windows MR users just the same.<\/p>\n<p>Getting the remote desktop streaming feature on Go will require a little finagling for PC users who will also have to download the Bigscreen app in the Steam or the Oculus Store on desktop in order to fire up the app. From there they just need to open Bigscreen &#8220;in desktop mode&#8221; and punch the code that pops up into their Go headset. For now, remote desktop streaming is only open to PC users, Shankar says the startup is hoping to work on Mac support for the app later this year.<\/p>\n<p>While Oculus launched a number of apps today at F8 focused on bringing users together in a social experience, none of them can do quite what Bigscreen does.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The focus is just different,&#8221; founder Darshan Shankar tells TechCrunch. &#8220;We&#8217;ve been so much more focused on utilitarian value and providing something for people to do that they already love doing as opposed to just social for the sake of doing social.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Bigscreen has raised $14 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz, True Venture, Presence Capital and others for this mission of delivering the VR use cases that it sees users asking for. Though the company started four years ago, this is the startup&#8217;s first foray into mobile VR which has constituted the bulk of headset sales over the past few years.<\/p>\n<p>The update is available now for Oculus Go and Gear VR users, support for Google Daydream is coming soon.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Oculus says that its new Go headset already boasts support for more than 1,000 titles out of the gate as of today.

And while they are able to find discounts and partnerships with beauty brands eager to partner with Birchbox, it can still be hard to keep distribution costs down, while also spending on sales and marketing to grow the business. Birchbox hopes that consumers will buy more full-sized products off of its website.<\/p>\n<p>Recaps are not uncommon, but they are usually a sign that a startup is struggling. However, it is an opportunity for Birchbox to raise cash and remain in business while it figures out a longer-term plan.<\/p>\n<p>Birchbox was founded in 2010 by Harvard Business alums Hayley Barna and Katia Beauchamp.

FaceDate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/facebook\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"facebook\">Facebook <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/facebook-dating\/\">launching a dating feature<\/a> where you can volunteer to make a profile that&#8217;s only visible to non-friends who&#8217;ve also opted in to looking for love. Facebook will match you based on all its data, and messaging will happen in a dedicated inbox rather than Messenger.<\/p>\n<p>Why: If Facebook wants to drive &#8220;meaningful connections&#8221;, it doesn&#8217;t get more meaningful than introducing you to your life partner. Facebook will have to be careful to keep everything private, as people already think it&#8217;s creepy or uncool. But investors love it, considering Tinder parent company Match Group&#8217;s share price fell 22 percent today.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1632209\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/facebook-meetups-matchmaker-tinder1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"383\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. &#8220;Clear History&#8221;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Facebook is building Clear History, a new privacy feature<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/facebook-announces-way-to-clear-history-of-apps-and-sites-youve-clicked\/\"> allowing users to delete data Facebook has collected from sites and apps that use its ads and analytics tool<\/a>. This means you can scrub some of your browsing history from Facebook\u2019s data store. Mark Zuckerberg likened this to deleting cookies from your browser history. It&#8217;s a nice gesture to the privacy-conscious, though it&#8217;ll make your Facebook experience less personalized.<\/p>\n<p>Why: Zuckerberg faced tons of questions from congress about data it collects from around the web. Users were pissed to learn they had little control over it. Clear History could quiet some cries for regulation.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1622081\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/how-to-privacy.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"361\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/instagram\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"instagram\">Instagram <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> video chat and anti-bullying<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/instagram-launches-video-chat\/\">Instagram is launching video chat,&nbsp;<\/a>which<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/01\/instagram-audio-video-calling\/\"> TechCrunch scooped in March<\/a> when we spotted the feature buried in its Android app. Meanwhile, Instagram is also getting a new filter to protect users from bullying comments, plus an improved Explore tab.<\/p>\n<p>Why: Instagram Direct messaging is super popular, but lacked video chat&#8230;which is also super popular on <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/messenger\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"messenger\">Messenger <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and WhatsApp. Combined with anti-bullying features, Instagram could become a safer and sillier place for teens to hang out &#8212; which is just what Facebook wants to defeat Snapchat.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1632210\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/instagram-video-calling-2001.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"356\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Facebook is reopening its app review process<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/facebook-re-opens-app-reviews-on-its-platform\/\">Facebook will re-open its app review process<\/a> following the pause it took after the Cambridge Analytica crisis \u2013 welcome news for developers.<\/p>\n<p>Why: Facebook couldn&#8217;t risk another sketchy app slipping through and selling user data, but it also has to keep developers loyal to its platform so they keep building experiences that attract users. Facebook was wise to balance safety and privacy with new developer capabilities today.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1619388\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/facebook-phone-app-api.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"361\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>5. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/oculus-vr\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"oculus-vr\">Oculus <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Go goes on sale for $199<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Oculus Go, Facebook&#8217;s cheap and capable standalone VR headset, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/199-oculus-go-vr-headset-goes-on-sale-today\/\">is now on sale<\/a>. It costs $199 for the version with 32GB of onboard storage, and $249 for the 64GB variety.<\/p>\n<p>Why: VR headsets where you have to stick your phone in are clumsy and prevent Facebook from controlling the whole experience. Instead of relying on the Samsung Gear headset shell and your iPhone or Android, Facebook gets to dictate everything about the perfect VR rig you can strap on first-timers.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1554002\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/oculus-go-gif.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"351\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Messenger simplifies and starts translation&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/facebook-messenger-translation\/\">Facebook is tiptoeing into translation of chat threads in Messenger<\/a>, starting with English-Spanish convos in the US within Marketplace. Meanwhile, Facebook is stripping out the camera and games tab to give Messenger a cleaner design.<\/p>\n<p>Why: Translation could deliver on the Facebook promise of bringing the world closer together by eradicating language barriers and letting people realize how much they have in common. But Messenger was getting way too bloated with so many new features, so the simplification should let the actually useful ones shine.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631528\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/facebook-messenger-translation.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"442\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>7.

They might seem like a novelty today, but at least they keep Facebook interesting.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1632215\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/facebook-vr-memories.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"381\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>8. <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/whatsapp\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"whatsapp\"><a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/whatsapp\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"whatsapp\">WhatsApp <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> hits 450 million stories users&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>WhatsApp&#8217;s Snapchat Stories clone&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/whatsapp-stories\/\">WhatsApp Status now has 450 million daily active users.<\/a>&nbsp;That&#8217;s well over 2X the user count of Snapchat&#8217;s whole app. And WhatsApp is also adding stickers and group video calling.<\/p>\n<p>Why: This is a big deal because Snapchat had a disastrous earnings call today where it sank to its slowest user growth rate ever while WhatsApp Status continues its explosive growth. Snapchat neglected the international market at first, and now WhatsApp has beaten it to the punch worldwide.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1485169\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/whatsapp-status.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"414\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Sharing to Facebook and Instagram Stories from other apps<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Starting with Spotify, SoundCloud, and GoPro, other apps can share photos and videos directly to Stories inside Facebook and Instagram.<\/p>\n<p>Why: Facebook wants to make its Stories more interesting than Snapchat&#8217;s. And this new wing of the platform could create a massive opportunity for music discovery, the likes of which we haven&#8217;t seen since Myspace.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1632217\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/sharing-facebook-instagram-stories-1.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"361\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>10.

At first you&#8217;ll get Facebook Watch, but expect apps like Netflix and Hulu to arrive eventually.<\/p>\n<p>Why: There just aren&#8217;t enough great VR experiences, but perhaps Facebook can get people spending more time in their headsets by creating a virtual big screen for 2D content.<\/p>\n<p><em>For more of TechCrunch&#8217;s F8 coverage, check out all our stories:<\/em><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/f8-2018\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/f8-2018-banner.png\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Day 1 of Facebook&#8217;s F8 conference was packed with announcements and updates.

Free Basics, an initiative under <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/internet-org\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"internet-org\">Internet.org, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> is an app that offers users in developing markets a &#8220;free&#8221; Facebook-centric version of the broader internet.<\/p>\n<p>The app provides users willing to sign up for Facebook with internet access that doesn&#8217;t count against their mobile plan \u2014 stuff like the weather and local news \u2014 but keeps them within a specially tailored version of the platform&#8217;s walled garden. The result in some countries with previously low connectivity rates was that the social network became synonymous with the internet itself \u2014 and as we&#8217;ve seen, that can lead to a<a href=\"https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/sheerafrenkel\/fake-news-spreads-trump-around-the-world?utm_term=.ugeQQ0AEJL#.fldwwYKa5x\"> whole host of very real problems<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1632137\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-5-16-22-pm.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"411\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The Outline reports that Free Basics has ended in &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/theoutline.com\/post\/4383\/facebook-quietly-ended-free-basics-in-myanmar-and-other-countries?zd=1&amp;zi=l6cwnzu2\">half a dozen nations and territories<\/a>,&#8221; including Bolivia, Papua New Guinea, Trinidad and Tobago, Republic of Congo, Anguilla, Saint Lucia and El Salvador. Facebook told TechCrunch that two international mobile providers have exited the program, accounting for the end of Free Basics in those countries.<\/p>\n<p>As a Facebook spokeswoman told TechCrunch, Facebook is still moving forward with the program:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re encouraged by the adoption of Free Basics. It is now available in more than 50 countries with 81 mobile operator partners around the world. Today, more than 1,500 services are available on Free Basics worldwide, provided to people in partnership with mobile operators.<\/p>\n<p>Free Basics remains live with the vast majority of participating operators who have opted to continue offering the service. We remain committed to bringing more people around the world online by breaking down barriers to connectivity.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Facebook confirmed to TechCrunch that Free Basics did indeed end in Myanmar in September 2017, a little over a year since its June 2016 launch in the country. The company clarified that Myanmar&#8217;s state-owned telecom Myanma Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) cooperated with the Myanmar government to shut down access to all free services, including Free Basics in September of last year. The move was part of a broader regulatory effort by the Myanmar government.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1632189\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-1632189 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/screen-shot-2018-05-01-at-7-17-14-pm.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"526\" \/><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Notification from MPT for users in Myanmar about the end of Free Basics<\/p><\/div>\n<p>In a <a href=\"http:\/\/mpt.com.mm\/en\/myanmars-mobile-network-operators-date-successfully-exceeded-50-million-subscribers\/\">press release<\/a>, MPT described how the regulation shaped policy for the country&#8217;s three major telecoms:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8230; As responsible operators, [MPT, Ooredoo and Telenor] abide by sound price competition practices \u2013 hallmarks of a healthy marketplace and to adhere to industry best practices and ethical business guidelines.<\/p>\n<p>This [includes] compliance with the authority imposed floor pricing as set out in the Post and Telecommunications Department\u2019s Pricing and Tariff Regulatory Framework of 28 June 2017, including refraining from behavior such as free distribution or sales of SIM cards and supplying services and handsets at below the cost including delivery.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>In Myanmar, Facebook&#8217;s Free Basics offering ran afoul of the same price floor regulations that restricted the distribution of free SIM cards.<\/p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Facebook&#8217;s Free Basics program is winding down for other reasons. In the case of the telecom Digicel, the company confirmed to TechCrunch that it ended access to Free Basics in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.digicelgroup.com\/en\/where-we-are\/caribbean-and-central-america.html\">El Salvador and some of its Caribbean markets<\/a>\u00a0due to commercial reasons on its end and that the decision was not a result of any action by Facebook or Internet.org.<\/p>\n<p>As the Free Basics program is part of a partnership between Facebook and local mobile providers, the latter can terminate access to the app at will. Still, it&#8217;s not clear if that was the case in all the countries in which the app is no longer available.<\/p>\n<p>In 2016,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2016\/may\/12\/facebook-free-basics-india-zuckerberg\">India regulated Facebook&#8217;s free internet deal<\/a> out of existence, effectively blocking Facebook&#8217;s access to its most sought-after new market in the process. Since then, vocal critics have called Facebook&#8217;s Internet.org efforts everything from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/2017\/jul\/27\/facebook-free-basics-developing-markets\">digital colonialism<\/a> to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2018\/04\/21\/world\/asia\/facebook-sri-lanka-riots.html\">a spark in the tinderbox<\/a> for countries dealing with targeted violence against religious minorities.<\/p>\n<p>Still, according to Facebook, even as some markets dry up, the program is quietly expanding. In late 2017 Facebook added Sudan and Cote d&#8217;Ivoire to its Free Basics roster. This year, Facebook launched the initiative in Cameroon and added additional mobile partners in Columbia and Peru.<\/p>\n<p>Myanmar&#8217;s access to Free Basics is now restricted, but Facebook indicated that its efforts to connect the country \u2014 and its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/features\/2017-07-10\/the-unprecedented-explosion-of-smartphones-in-myanmar\">54 million<\/a> newly minted or yet to be converted Facebook users \u2014 are not over.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>As recently as last week, Facebook was touting the growth of Free Basics, its Internet.org project designed to give users free curated web access in developing countries, but the app isn&#8217;t working out everywhere.

co-founder and CEO of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.healthtap.com\">HealthTap<\/a>, a venture-backed medical advice startup, was reportedly elbowed out today by his board of directors. The reason, the board said in a letter to employees, was that it had finally heard too many complaints about Gutman&#8217;s behavior inside the company.<\/p>\n<p>Recode published the news of his termination earlier, along with excerpts of an explainer provided to Gutman that alleges he &#8220;committed acts of intimidation, abuse, and mistrust, and that [he] repeatedly mistreated, threatened, harassed and verbally abused employees.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThis leaves us with no choice but to fire you,&#8221; reads the letter. &#8220;The toxicity you introduced into the workplace ends now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The development may seem curious to those who followed Gutman&#8217;s earlier career. Back in 2011, Gutman was on the TED speaking circuit, talking passionately about the power of smiling and attracting a great deal of publicity in the process. His <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ted.com\/talks\/ron_gutman_the_hidden_power_of_smiling\">2011 presentation<\/a> has been watched nearly five million times; it later spawned a book, published by TED, called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Smile-Astonishing-Powers-Simple-Kindle-ebook\/dp\/B006IS4WW0\"><em>Smile: The Astonishing Powers of a Simple Act<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Gutman, a Stanford grad, has denied that he abused his employees in a public statement that reads: \u201cThe actions of the VCs are harmful to the Company and in violation of their duties. I will not stand for their effort to take control of the Company unfairly and to the detriment of the Company. I will continue to fight for <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/healthtap\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"healthtap\">HealthTap <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and for all of our employees, our customers and our users all over the world. My team and I remain committed to saving lives and help people live healthier happier longer lives.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not the first time that Gutman has found himself at the center of a controversy.<\/p>\n<p>Nine years ago, Gutman sold an earlier startup of his, Wellsphere, to a much larger (and, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/SB944624130739132790\">for a minute<\/a>, publicly traded) rival called HealthCentral, which at the time was a collection of consumer health and wellness information.<\/p>\n<p>Terms of the deal were never disclosed, but plenty of complaints surfaced after the sale, by bloggers who claimed that Wellsphere had tricked them into agreeing to an &#8220;<a href=\"http:\/\/more-distractible.org\/musings\/2009\/01\/28\/all-is-not-wellsphere\">irrevocable, perpetual license<\/a>&#8221; to use, make or sell whatever content they had posted to the company&#8217;s website. Why they found this so galling: To grow its &#8220;well&#8221; of content into something sellable, Wellsphere reached out to more than 1,700 medical bloggers, appealing to their self-perception as &#8220;true medical experts&#8221; and inviting them to publish even their previously posted material to its platform.<\/p>\n<p>Gutman founded HealthTap the very next year, in 2010.<\/p>\n<p>What happens to the company now is a bit of a question mark. HealthTap has raised nearly $40 million over the years, including from Mohr Davidow Ventures, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/khosla-ventures\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"khosla-ventures\">Khosla Ventures, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> Mayfield and Eric Schmidt\u2019s Innovation Endeavors. But it hasn&#8217;t raised fresh funding in five years &#8212; a sign, oftentimes, that investors aren&#8217;t prepared to throw more money at a company.<\/p>\n<p>For now, says Recode, Gutman is being replaced by Bill Gossman, a software CEO whose LinkedIn profile shows that he also has been a longtime venture partner with Mohr Davidow. In the board&#8217;s letter to employees, it calls Gossman &#8220;the right leader for the company at this time.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>You can read the board&#8217;s letter in its entirety below:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Dear HealthTap Team,<\/p>\n<p>The Board of Directors has decided to make a change in company leadership. As of this morning, Ron Gutman is no longer the President and CEO of HealthTap, nor is he employed by the Company in any capacity. He is also no longer a member of the Board of Directors.<\/p>\n<p>After receiving concerning reports by employees about Ron\u2019s conduct as CEO, the Board of Directors hired an outside law firm to conduct an investigation into these allegations. What we learned left us with no choice but to make this change, and we did so after taking the necessary steps from a corporate governance perspective.<\/p>\n<p>Last evening the Board voted to appoint Bill Gossman as CEO and also elected him to the Board of Directors. He begins his position immediately. Bill is a tenured executive with a wealth of experience in enterprise software, consumer internet and mobile applications. Those of us who have worked with Bill in the past have witnessed his transparent, empowering leadership style, and we firmly believe he is the right leader for the company at this time.<\/p>\n<p>There will be an all-hands meeting this morning at 9:30AM in Palo Alto, where you will get to meet Bill and hear about his near-term plans for the Company. You will also hear from the Board. We ask that employees in the San Francisco office join by video conference if they are unable to attend the meeting in person.<\/p>\n<p>We are confident this change is the right thing to do and in the best interests of the Company. We want HealthTap to offer an atmosphere where employees are treated professionally and respectfully \u2013 and where they are rewarded for their contributions. We believe that by working together under Bill\u2019s leadership, we can achieve HealthTap\u2019s full potential.<\/p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued hard work and dedication to HealthTap.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Ron Gutman, the co-founder and CEO of HealthTap, a venture-backed medical advice startup, was reportedly elbowed out today by his board of directors.

app created by a high schooler is a step towards all-purpose visual search"},"content":{"rendered":"<p>A couple of years ago I was eagerly expectant of an app that would identify anything you pointed it at. Turns out the problem was much harder than anyone expected \u2014 but that didn&#8217;t stop high school senior Michael Royzen from trying. <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/smartlens-ai-visual-search\/id1321769496?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">His app, SmartLens,<\/a> attempts to solve the problem of seeing something and wanting to identify and learn more about it \u2014 with mixed success, to be sure, but it&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t mind having in my pocket.<\/p>\n<p>Royzen reached out to me a while back and I was curious \u2014 as well as skeptical \u2014 about the idea that where the likes of Google and Apple have so far failed (or at least failed to release anything good), a high schooler working in his spare time would succeed. I met him at a coffee shop to see the app in action and was pleasantly surprised, but a little baffled.<\/p>\n<p>The idea is simple, of course: You point your phone&#8217;s camera at something and the app attempts to identify it using an enormous but highly optimized classification agent trained on tens of millions of images. It connects to Wikipedia and Amazon to let you immediately learn more about what you&#8217;ve ID&#8217;ed, or buy it.<\/p>\n<p>It recognizes more than 17,000 objects \u2014 things like different species of fruit and flower, landmarks, tools and so on. The app had little trouble telling an apple from a (weird-looking) mango, a banana from a plantain and even identified the pistachios I&#8217;d ordered as a snack. Later, in my own testing, I found it quite useful for identifying the plants springing up in my neighborhood: periwinkles, anemones, wood sorrel, it got them all, though not without the occasional hesitation.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignright size-full wp-image-1632036\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/smartlens_screens.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"741\" \/>The kicker is that this all happens offline \u2014 it&#8217;s not sending an image over the cell network or Wi-Fi to a server somewhere to be analyzed. It all happens on-device and within a second or two. Royzen scraped his own image database from various sources and trained up multiple convolutional neural networks using days of AWS EC2 compute time.<\/p>\n<p>Then there are far more than that number in products that it recognizes by reading the text of the item and querying the Amazon database. It ID&#8217;ed books, a bottle of pills and other packaged goods almost instantly, providing links to buy them. Wikipedia links pop up if you&#8217;re online as well, though a considerable amount of basic descriptions are kept on the device.<\/p>\n<p>On that note, it must be said that SmartLens is a more than 500-megabyte download. Royzen&#8217;s model is huge, since it must keep all the recognition data and offline content right there on the phone. This is a much different approach to the problem than Amazon&#8217;s own product recognition engine on the Fire Phone (RIP) or Google Goggles (RIP) or the scan feature in Google Photos (which was pretty useless for things SmartLens reliably did in half a second).<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout wp-image-1632042 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/smartlens_screen.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"877\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;With the several past generations of smartphones containing desktop-class processors and the advent of native machine learning APIs that can harness them (and GPUs), the hardware exists for a blazing-fast visual search engine,&#8221; Royzen wrote in an email. But none of the large companies you would expect to create one has done so. Why?<\/p>\n<p>The app size and toll on the processor is one thing, for sure, but the edge and on-device processing is where all this stuff will go eventually \u2014 Royzen is just getting an early start. The likely truth is twofold: it&#8217;s hard to make money and the quality of the search isn&#8217;t high enough.<\/p>\n<p>It must be said at this point that SmartLens, while smart, is far from infallible. Its suggestions for what an item might be are almost always hilariously wrong for a moment before arriving at, as it often does, the correct answer.<\/p>\n<p>It identified one book I had as &#8220;White Whale,&#8221; and no, it wasn&#8217;t Moby Dick. An actual whale paperweight it decided was a trowel. Many items briefly flashed guesses of &#8220;Human being&#8221; or &#8220;Product design&#8221; before getting to a guess with higher confidence. One flowering bush it identified as four or five different plants \u2014 including, of course, Human Being. My monitor was a &#8220;computer display,&#8221; &#8220;liquid crystal display,&#8221; &#8220;computer monitor,&#8221; &#8220;computer,&#8221; &#8220;computer screen,&#8221; &#8220;display device&#8221; and more. Game controllers were all &#8220;control.&#8221; A spatula was a wooden spoon (close enough), with the inexplicable subheading &#8220;booby prize.&#8221; What?!<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"breakout alignright size-full wp-image-1632076\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/boobyprize.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"867\" \/>This level of performance (and weirdness in general, however entertaining) wouldn&#8217;t be tolerated in a standalone product released by Google or Apple. Google Lens was slow and bad, but it&#8217;s just an optional feature in a working, useful app. If it put out a visual search app that identified flowers as people, the company would never hear the end of it.<\/p>\n<p>And the other side of it is the monetization aspect. Although it&#8217;s theoretically convenient to be able to snap a picture of a book your friend has and instantly order it, it isn&#8217;t so much more convenient than taking a picture and searching for it later, or just typing the first few words into Google or Amazon, which will do the rest for you.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile for the user there is still confusion. What can it identify? What can&#8217;t it identify? What do I need it to identify? It&#8217;s meant to ID many things, from dog breeds and storefronts, but it likely won&#8217;t identify, for example, a cool Bluetooth speaker or mechanical watch your friend has, or the creator of a painting at a local gallery (some paintings are recognized, though). As I used it I felt like I was only ever going to use it for a handful of tasks in which it had proven itself, like identifying flowers, but would be hesitant to try it on many other things when I might just be frustrated by some unknown incapability or unreliability.<\/p>\n<p>And yet the idea that in the very near future there will <em>not<\/em> be something just like SmartLens is ridiculous to me. It seems so clearly something we will all take for granted in a few years. And it&#8217;ll be on-device, no need to upload your image to a server somewhere to be analyzed on your behalf.<\/p>\n<p>Royzen&#8217;s app has its issues, but it works very well in many circumstances and has obvious utility. The idea that you could point your phone at the restaurant you&#8217;re across the street from and see Yelp reviews two seconds later \u2014 no need to open up a map or type in an address or name \u2014 is an extremely natural expansion of existing search paradigms.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Visual search is still a niche, but my goal is to give people the taste of a future where one app can deliver useful information about anything around them \u2014 today,&#8221; wrote Royzen. &#8220;Still, it\u2019s inevitable that big companies will launch their competing offerings eventually. My strategy is to beat them to market as the first universal visual search app and amass as many users as possible so I can stay ahead (or be acquired).&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>My biggest gripe of all, however, is not the functionality of the app, but in how Royzen has decided to monetize it. Users can download it for free but upon opening it are immediately prompted to sign up for a $2\/month subscription (though the first month is free) \u2014 before they can even see whether the app works or not. If I didn&#8217;t already know what the app did and didn&#8217;t do, I would delete it without a second thought upon seeing that dialog, and even knowing what I do, I&#8217;m not likely to pay in perpetuity for it.<\/p>\n<p>A one-time fee to activate the app would be more than reasonable, and there&#8217;s always the option of referral codes for those Amazon purchases. But demanding rent from users who haven&#8217;t even tested the product is a non-starter. I&#8217;ve told Royzen my concerns and I hope he reconsiders.<\/p>\n<p>It would also be nice to scan images you&#8217;ve already taken, or save images associated with searches. UI improvements like a confidence indicator or some kind of feedback to let you know it&#8217;s still working on identification would be nice as well \u2014 features that are at least theoretically on the way.<\/p>\n<p>In the end I&#8217;m impressed with Royzen&#8217;s efforts \u2014 when I take a step back it&#8217;s amazing to me that it&#8217;s possible for a single person, let alone one in high school, to put together an app capable of completing such sophisticated computer vision tasks. It&#8217;s the kind of (over-) ambitious app-building one expects to come out of a big, playful company like the Google of a decade ago. This may be more of a curiosity than a tool right now, but so were the first text-based search engines.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/app\/smartlens-ai-visual-search\/id1321769496?ls=1&amp;mt=8\">SmartLens is in the App Store now<\/a> \u2014 give it a shot.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>A couple years ago I was eagerly expectant of an app that would identify anything you pointed it at.

birthday, simply to avoid the non-stop barrage of alerts that someone had posted &#8220;Happy Birthday!&#8221; to your timeline? A fix may be in the works, as it turns out. An update to how Facebook will handle birthday notifications was given a brief mention during today&#8217;s keynote address at the company&#8217;s F8 developer conference, hinting at a new birthday feature yet to come.<\/p>\n<p>The feature wasn&#8217;t one of Facebook&#8217;s demos, and the company is declining to share more details about its launch at this time.<\/p>\n<p>However, the general idea is that Facebook could leverage the Stories format to create &#8220;birthday packages&#8221; that are sent once to users at the end of the day, instead of having users post messages to the friends&#8217; timelines.<\/p>\n<p>This was mentioned briefly alongside other ideas for how Stories will be expanded &#8212; like the upcoming launch of collaborative Stories, and a Stories option that allows video clipping, for example.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;And then birthdays,&#8221; added Facebook Chief Product Officer Chris Cox in his keynote address. &#8220;Instead of all of us writing on your wall to wish you a &#8216;happy birthday,&#8217; how about we pull together, over the course of the day, a photo and video reel, which you then receive as a package at the end, saying, &#8216;happy birthday.'&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear when this feature will actually arrive, but we understand Facebook isn&#8217;t commenting publicly because the product team is still working on what this new &#8220;happy birthday&#8221; feature will look like.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not likely to prevent anyone from writing on a friend&#8217;s timeline, we&#8217;d imagine &#8212; but it could be a change to how Facebook prompts you to remember your friend&#8217;s or family member&#8217;s birthday. (Today, Facebook prompts you to post to their timeline, but that could be tweaked to encourage users to leave messages via Stories instead.)<\/p>\n<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Facebook has attempted to fix the <a href=\"https:\/\/beta.techcrunch.com\/2011\/12\/25\/love-scales\/?_ga=2.167919394.2019247569.1525095193-1447864512.1494524635#link-target\">age-old<\/a> Happy Birthday spam problem. It has also done things like group birthday posts together, and it has consistently tried to get people to use video with things <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/02\/22\/insert-generic-birthday-message\/\">like Birthday Cam in 2016<\/a>,&nbsp; and later<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/08\/16\/facebook-birthday-video-fundraiser\/\">&nbsp;personalized but automated video messages.&nbsp;<\/a><\/p>\n<p>It has also attempted to<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/07\/28\/facebook-birthday-videos\/\"> bundle birthday greetings into recap videos<\/a>, which is the experience that sounds most similar to what Facebook is now teasing with this Happy Birthday Stories feature. Perhaps the recap video will make a comeback, but be presented not within your News Feed or Timeline, but as a personalized Story built for you.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, if you <em>really<\/em> don&#8217;t like the birthday spam, you could just remove your birthday information from your Facebook profile ahead of the actual day.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/f8-2018\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/f8-2018-banner.png\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Have you ever turned off Facebook&#8217;s notifications or even deleted the app entirely on your birthday, simply to avoid the non-stop barrage of alerts that someone had posted &#8220;Happy Birthday!&#8221; to your timeline?

Corporation.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The security community is still reeling from the discoveries of the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/03\/kernel-panic-what-are-meltdown-and-spectre-the-bugs-affecting-nearly-every-computer-and-device\/\">Meltdown and Spectre<\/a> computer vulnerabilities, and now it seems that <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/13\/security-researchers-find-flaws-in-amd-chips-but-raise-eyebrows-with-rushed-disclosure\/\">a rash of new hardware vulnerabilities<\/a> called MasterKey, RyzenFall, Fallout and Chimera have been found in the past few months, too.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unlike most previous threats, all these vulnerabilities attack a computer\u2019s hardware, rather than its software. This second release of attacks may be early indications that <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/meltdown\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"meltdown\">Meltdown <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> and Spectre have opened a new front in the war between hackers and defenders in the realm of computer chips.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While experts are working to make and distribute patches for these bugs, the question remains: What does this mean for cybersecurity as a whole? The answer to that question starts with understanding a bit about how hackers work.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hackers are a social and trendy bunch. A couple of years ago, hacking onboard computers on cars was common, so a bunch of vulnerabilities were found and patched and now cars have become somewhat harder to commandeer. Then drone hacking was all the rage, and drone manufacturers too have implemented patches and become somewhat more secure.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is how cyber defenses work. Some smart researcher finds a new hole. If they\u2019re nice (most are nice), they tell the manufacturers about it so they can fix the bugs. With Meltdown and <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/spectre\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"spectre\">Spectre, <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> the researchers were nice and informed the manufacturers months beforehand. The MasterKey, RyzenFall, Fallout and Chimera researchers were not so nice, and only gave them a day. If the researchers are really not nice and decide instead to use their exploit, then some unlucky person or organization is probably going to have a very bad day.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That moment of discovery is the starting gun for an intense race between the defense community and the hacker community. Some hacker genius somewhere already knows how to use the bug and other hacker geniuses start working overtime to write their own code that exploits it.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once a few of them figure it out, one of them will write a simpler version for people who don\u2019t understand the details so that hackers who aren\u2019t geniuses can use it too. Soon after that, it gets included in the common hacking databases. From that point on, anyone can literally point and click their way into your computer.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Although not much can be done for the folks who already had their bad day, the defense community, as a whole, almost always wins that race. As soon as their fastest programmer finds a fix, it can be quickly distributed throughout the world, making the new hacking toys only useful against the stragglers who fell behind the herd. And these days, it\u2019s gotten pretty hard to fall behind. The patching process has become invisibly smooth, and most regular computer users never even know that there was a race on.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With hardware vulnerabilities, things could be different. You can\u2019t change hardware by sending an invisible string of 1s and 0s through the air. For Meltdown and Spectre, workarounds where changing the software can help block the hardware problem are still being figured out and distributed. These workarounds showed up quickly at first, but the process has been anything but smooth, and proof-of-concept code for exploiting these vulnerabilities has been seen online for more than a month. As for the more recent vulnerabilities, it\u2019s not clear yet what workarounds exist, and there might not always be a workaround that creates software solutions to hardware problems.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though stark, this situation is not entirely unprecedented. Some operating systems are no longer supported by their vendors, which means that any new hole will go un-patched. The most famous example is Windows XP. Most people know by now that using Windows XP is not safe, but don\u2019t fully understand how unsafe it is.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, any computer-savvy high schooler can watch a YouTube video and learn in just a couple hours how to point and click their way to control of someone else\u2019s computer on the internet, so long as it is running Windows XP. Even with Windows XP though, when a truly nasty bug comes out, <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/microsoft\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"microsoft\">Microsoft <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> can choose to go back and patch it like they did last year for the WannaCry ransomware. With a nasty hardware vulnerability, that may not even be an option.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what can be done? Hopefully, the hacking community will not become enthralled with searching for hardware vulnerabilities. They might not. It is hard and requires rare expertise that is not as easy to come by as software hacking. If we are not so lucky, then defending the herd by responding quickly to the first attack may no longer be a viable approach &#8212; but herd immunity comes in many forms.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Perhaps it will be from increased diversity of chip designs or perhaps approaches to slow the spread of information from hacker genius to amateur. Perhaps it will be from improved perimeter defenses, although hardware at the perimeter may be just as vulnerable as the rest.<\/p>\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Time and again, the adaptability of the world\u2019s smartest engineers have overcome the most dire threats to computing and the internet. The safe money is on them to win the day again, but with hardware vulnerabilities it may require a whole new approach for defending the herd.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The

href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/blog\/post\/2018\/05\/01\/in-app-purchases-instant-game-platform\/\">announced<\/a> during a session on gaming at its F8 developer conference this afternoon. The feature will allow game developers to add another form of monetization beyond advertising to their games on select platforms, but not on iOS.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, support for in-app purchases will be available to Instant Games on Android and on Facebook.com on the web.<\/p>\n<p>First <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/29\/messenger-instant-games\/\">launched<\/a> in 2016, Facebook <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/03\/15\/facebook-opens-instant-games-to-all-developers\/\">opened up<\/a> Instant Games to all developers last month. The platform allows developers to build mobile-friendly games using HTML5 that work across both Facebook and Messenger. The idea is to give game developers access to another sizable platform for their work, in addition to the existing app stores run by Apple and Google.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook has had in-app purchases on its roadmap for Instant Games for some time, and began testing the feature with select developers around six months ago.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-large wp-image-1632023\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/instant-games-iap-in-everwing.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"357\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Similar to the app stores, the revenue share model for Instant Games is 70\/30 on Facebook.com. However, on mobile, the games will follow the in-app billing terms from each platform, the company notes. That means purchases made in games running on Android devices, the 30 percent revenue share will apply after the standard mobile platform revenue share &#8212; aka Google&#8217;s own 70\/30 cut.<\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s not ideal, of course. And all the hands in the pie may lead to game developers pricing their in-app purchases higher, as a result.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook seems to acknowledge this concern in its blog post announcement, saying: &#8220;Our primary goal is to build [in-app purchases] in a way so that our developer partners can sustain and grow, and we&#8217;ll continue to evaluate rev\/share with that goal in mind.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Facebook wouldn&#8217;t confirm if or when support for in-app purchases is coming to iOS.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to helping developers generate revenue outside of using ads in their games, in-app purchases in games could prove beneficial to Facebook as well. The company&#8217;s payment revenue has dwindled over the years, with things like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/04\/11\/facebook-messenger-now-supports-group-payments\/\">Messenger payments<\/a> never really seeing significant attention. Plus, Facebook made it possible for <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2017\/10\/20\/you-can-now-paypal-friends-in-messenger-and-get-help-via-chat\/\">third-parties like PayPal<\/a> to operate over Messenger, which signaled its disinterest in the payments space in general.<\/p>\n<p>In-app purchases in games turns things around, a bit.<\/p>\n<p>The submission process for in-app purchases will open up to developers on May 7, allowing them to implement the monetization features on Android and the web. In the meantime, Facebook is offering documentation about the feature <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.facebook.com\/docs\/games\/instant-games\/guides\/in-app-purchases\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/f8-2018\/\"><img src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/f8-2018-banner.png\"\/><\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facebook is adding support for in-app purchases to its Instant Games platform, the company announced during a session on gaming at its F8 developer conference this afternoon.

ever been invented. Every day, billions of people open apps and scroll through algorithmically selected content designed to emotively engage us. Through the feed, we enter an intellectual stupor, downloading information to our brains without critical thought, without filters. Who ultimately controls those feeds, and can they use that control to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/111\/24\/8788\">change not just the emotions of their audience<\/a>, but our very understanding of reality?<\/p>\n<p>The feed and its discontents is the theme undergirding <a href=\"http:\/\/www.eliotpeper.com\/2018\/05\/bandwidth.html\">Bandwidth<\/a>, the latest science fiction novel by Eliot Peper, released today by Amazon Publishing imprint 47North. The novel, the author\u2019s sixth, is the story of Dag Calhoun, a lobbyist who gets caught up in a war over climate change and the world\u2019s response to it. In this telling, activists fight not through picket signs and petitions, but instead with the modern weaponry of algorithms \u2014 controlling the feeds of global leaders to change their very understanding of the world.<\/p>\n<p>The book is straight out of the Peper oeuvre, combining a thriller plot with a deeper introspection of technology and its effect on our actions and our futures. It\u2019s an engaging, electric read, but also one that forces us to confront the state of the world today and our impact as an industry on politics.<\/p>\n<p>The book is also the latest milestone in the entrepreneurial writing career of Peper, who migrated from the startup and VC worlds to pursue his creative passions full-time. He describes his background as \u201ca bit of a pinball career path,\u201d studying international environmental policy, working at a plasma arc startup in the clean energy space and then working at a venture firm.<\/p>\n<p>Yet through all of those experiences, something was gnawing on him about the content that he was reading, particularly about business. \u201cFolks don\u2019t want to publicize some of their less overtly positive experiences,\u201d Peper said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to throw shade on other people, so business books sometimes miss some of the human experiences.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Peper, who has been a voracious reader his entire life, thought he could offer that missing link by writing speculative fiction. \u201cWriting fiction, you have to synthesize your ideas about the world,\u201d he explained, and \u201cput that all in a story that is compelling and illuminates something about the world for readers.\u201d That led to his first trilogy of novels called the Uncommon Stock series, which are thrillers set against the backdrop of a fast-growing startup and show the sorts of highs and lows (and danger!) you don\u2019t get in the business shelves.<\/p>\n<p>Over time though, Peper has grown more philosophical about technology and its role in society, using his plots to explore ever more complicated connections of accelerating technological change. \u201cWe live in this world where our institutions and the tools we use every day are changing fast,\u201d he explains, arguing that \u201cmy grandparents wouldn\u2019t understand many, many things about my life today.\u201d Peper often gets ideas for novels from the news and general events happening, and uses the medium of the novel to explore their nuances in-depth.<\/p>\n<p>That sort of thinking shows up in Cumulus, his fourth novel about an eponymous company that utilizes its vast user data to provide better transportation services called Fleet, but also uses that data to attempt to block criticism of the company. Peper, who is a native of Oakland, California, integrates the vast inequality that technology has created in Silicon Valley into the core of the plot.<\/p>\n<p>For Bandwidth, Peper wanted to respond to the challenges of the 2016 election, and the challenges of managing one\u2019s own media diet. \u201cIn 2016 with the presidential campaign running in full swing, it felt that there was so much news that it was almost hard to escape from,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wanted to take more agency in the ideas and the stories I was inviting into my own heart.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That thinking led Peper to start speculating on what would happen if you controlled that intake. \u201cIf you could personally curate the media diet of someone else, could you control their thinking \u2026 could you change their world view? That was the seed of Bandwidth,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>Bandwidth is the first work in a trilogy, although each novel will be independent, set in the same universe but with different characters and themes. The next book is called Borderless, and will focus on the decline of the nation-state, and comes out October 30th.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The feed is the greatest psychological and mental manipulation tool that has ever been invented.

We are currently rolling out an update to address this by sorting communication by recency and moving Stories from friends to the right side of the application, while maintaining the structural changes we have made around separating friends from creators and sorting friends\u2019 Stories by relationships.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Spiegel relayed that user behavior on iOS is starting to stabilize, but &#8220;performance regressions&#8221; on Android related to the redesign have contributed to the app&#8217;s overall growth troubles.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"47jLS6WHJJ\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-q1-2018-earnings\/\">Snapchat slips in Q1 to its slowest user growth rate ever, shares fall 16%<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-q1-2018-earnings\/embed\/#?secret=47jLS6WHJJ\" data-secret=\"47jLS6WHJJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat slips in Q1 to its slowest user growth rate ever, shares fall 16%&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Snap had previously tested this change, and also tried <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/07\/snapchat-brings-back-chronological-stories-feed-for-some\/\">creating separate tabs for Chat and chronologically sorted Stories<\/a> inside the Friends section on the left side of the app. Below you can see the new version of Discover, which shows preview tiles of friends&#8217; Stories up top, sorted by who you interact with most. It&#8217;s reminiscent of Instagram Stories, which also uses a horizontal scrolling row of Stories.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"vertical aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631984\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/discover1.png?w=383\" alt=\"\" width=\"383\" height=\"680\" \/><\/p>\n<p>I think this design is still a mess. It takes Snapchat&#8217;s pioneering Stories product and buries it amongst all the professional content inside Discover. Essentially, Snapchat has taken its redesign philosophy too far. Originally it pulled brands and social media stars out of the Stories list and put them in Discover because it didn&#8217;t want your friends&#8217; Stories to have to compete with the pros. But now those Stories and the pro content are all crammed into one screen.<\/p>\n<p>What Snap needs to do is create tabs for relevancy sorted Stories and\u00a0chronologically sorted messages in the friends side of the app, and keep all professional content in the Discover section, but with the option to subscribe to your favorite creators to move them over to the Friends&#8217; story lists.<\/p>\n<p>Spiegel says he expects users metrics to stabilize as people get used to the redesign. But Snapchat doesn&#8217;t have time to be patient. Its losses are mounting and the growth of WhatsApp Status is explosive. That Facebook-owned Stories clone now has 450 million daily users. Snapchat needs to stuff its pride and philosophy and drill down into what users actually want. Spiegel has always gone by his gut, but this awful earnings report should give him indigestion.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Snapchat&#8217;s redesign was a disaster.

href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/apple\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"apple\">Apple <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> ended up with a pretty decent report for its second quarter, beating analyst expectations on most of its metrics \u2014 but it is making a huge move in terms of returning capital to investors.<\/p>\n<p>The company said it is announcing a new $100 billion buyback program and increasing its dividend by 16%. That means that Apple investors are going to get more of an opportunity to snap up the value the company has created over time as it&#8217;s continued to grow significantly. While Apple in the past several months a lot of the momentum that carried it to a market cap nearing $1 trillion, the company&#8217;s stock has still risen around 80% in the past two years. Not surprisingly, the stock today is soaring (by Apple standards) in extended trading, with shares rising nearly 5% after the report.<\/p>\n<p>Last quarter Apple CFO Luca Maestri said the company expected to be &#8220;net cash neutral&#8221; over time, signaling that it might start returning more capital to shareholders through its dividend and share buyback programs. That&#8217;ll be important for the company, which thanks to the tax bill last year will be able to repatriate a significant amount of the cash it holds outside of the U.S. These kinds of returns are pretty common with larger companies that generate a ton of cash \u2014 Apple already had some buyback programs in place, for example \u2014 but investors have always dinged Apple for not deploying its massive pile of cash.<\/p>\n<p>This quarter, however, Apple&#8217;s pile of cash actually <em>fell<\/em>. Apple continued to add more and more cash to its reserves, though a significant amount of it was overseas. This quarter it fell to $267.2 billion, down $17.9 billion from the last quarter.\u00a0From August 2012 to March 2018, Apple has returned around $275 billion in capital to Wall Street. That included a collective $200 billion in share repurchases. Apple has had some of these programs in place, but this is still a substantial addition to its capital return plans.<\/p>\n<p>The rest of the line was a pretty solid beat on expectations Apple&#8217;s services revenue continues to grow as it looks to create a steady additional revenue stream. All that&#8217;s important too, of course, but the big news here is the set of buybacks.\u00a0Here&#8217;s the bottom line:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Q2 Revenue:<\/strong>\u00a0$61.1 billion, compared to analyst estimates of $60.86 billion. Apple projected between $60 billion and $62 billion.

Last year, the company released the iPhone X \u2014 which was widely praised, but also carried a substantial $999 price tag for the cheapest model. Apple has worked to create programs to pay for those phones over time, but it&#8217;s still an extremely high ticket price. That&#8217;s especially true internationally, where consumers might not tolerate high prices for those phones. As a result, the reception on Wall Street was pretty muted, and Apple seems to have to figure out some other way to restart that iPhone growth engine.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631927\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/apple-stock-chart.png?w=549\" alt=\"\" width=\"549\" height=\"582\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Toward the end of last year, it seemed like Apple was inching closer to being a company with a market cap over $1 trillion. That&#8217;s a completely symbolic number, but nonetheless would be a significant milestone for the iPhone maker that looks to figure out what a next-generation smartphone looks like. Apple&#8217;s stock has by no means been in a tailspin, but it hasn&#8217;t really done anything either as expectations start to drop a bit following the launch of the iPhone X.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple ended up with a pretty decent report for its second quarter, beating analyst expectations on most of its metrics \u2014 but it is making a huge move in terms of returning capital to investors.

Snapchat reached only 191 million daily active users, up from 187 million, with its growth rate sinking to 2.13 percent &#8212; its slowest ever, compared to 5.05 percent in Q4 and a disastrous 2.9 percent in Q3.

It&#8217;s actually worse than it looks. CEO Evan Spiegel wrote in his prepared remarks that compared to its 191 million users quarterly average, &#8220;our March average was lower, but still above our Q4 average.&#8221; The idea that Snapchat actually shrank last month should terrify investors.<\/p>\n<p>Snapchat is going to have ongoing trouble significantly increasing its user count with over 300 million daily users on Instagram Stories, and 450 million on WhatsApp Status &#8212; both clones of Snapchat.

That&#8217;s another spot Snap was hoping to improve with cost-cutting layoffs, but those were too little too late. COO Imran Khan warned that &#8220;as we think about our year-over-year revenue growth rates, we are planning for our Q2 growth rate to decelerate substantially from Q1 levels.&#8221; That&#8217;s another reason investors are bolting.<\/p>\n<p>One of the few bright spots of the earnings report was the reveal of Snap Pro For Busines and Creators. It&#8217;s an app for public figures and businesses to run their Snapchat presence. Khan wrote that the product will make it\u00a0&#8220;easier to manage a public profile, create and distribute content, understand audience insights, and ultimately, advertise with us.&#8221; Rollout is still very early, though.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"mYewRt9Tae\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-reredesign\/\">Snapchat scrambles to fix failed redesign, moves Stories to Discover<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-reredesign\/embed\/#?secret=mYewRt9Tae\" data-secret=\"mYewRt9Tae\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;Snapchat scrambles to fix failed redesign, moves Stories to Discover&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Snap also saw an unprecedented decline in its average revenue per user in North America.

That indicates serious problems monetizing that could be due to fewer Stories or Discover ad views during Q1.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our redesign created some headwinds in our revenue this quarter by disrupting user behavior and creating some apprehension among our advertising partners&#8221; Spiegel admitted. That&#8217;s why Snapchat is now <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/snapchat-reredesign\/\">rolling out a big re-redesign<\/a> that jams Stories into the Discover page, which still seems worse than the original design.

Celebrity <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2018-02-22\/snap-royalty-kylie-jenner-erased-a-billion-dollars-in-one-tweet\">backlash<\/a> and anecdotal declines in usage for some people have pushed Snap to waffle on the changes, in some cases <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/04\/07\/snapchat-brings-back-chronological-stories-feed-for-some\/\">changing the app to work more like the old version<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-1631954\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/05\/snapchat-user-growth-q1-2018.png?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"353\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Snap just launched version 2 of its Spectacles camera sunglasses, but we&#8217;ll have to wait until next quarter to see any revenue from that. The question will be whether Snapchat&#8217;s<a href=\"https:\/\/cheddar.com\/videos\/exclusive-snap-plans-biggest-round-of-layoffs-yet-totaling-120-engineers\"> layoffs of over 120 staffers<\/a> will start to make a dent in its big losses, because it certainly didn&#8217;t show up this quarter.<\/p>\n<p>During the call, Spiegel said he&#8217;s hoping that separating creators from friends will help Snap build an audience for them so they make it the favored home for their content. But even if it improves creator discovery, it&#8217;s hard to compete with the sheer size of Instagram and WhatsApp. CFO Drew Volero meanwhile said that Snap is trying to get to break-even, but there&#8217;s no timeline for that\/ Producing $385 million more in revenue per quarter is going to be a massive challenge without significant user growth, especially with reduced headcount from layoffs.<\/p>\n<p>As I wrote early this year, &#8220;The popularity of Snapchat messaging amongst western teenagers means it won\u2019t disappear overnight. But it may be time for it and the world to face the fact that Snapchat could be a world-changing product without ever becoming a world-dominating business.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"nZsVFYyVT2\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/09\/the-ever-ending-story\/\">What is Snapchat, now that Story sharing has stopped growing?<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/01\/09\/the-ever-ending-story\/embed\/#?secret=nZsVFYyVT2\" data-secret=\"nZsVFYyVT2\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" title=\"&#8220;What is Snapchat, now that Story sharing has stopped growing?&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>Honestly, Snap is in serious trouble.

According to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the dating functionality will be a standalone feature that will focus on legitimate long-term relationships, rather than just hookups.<\/p>\n<p>Though, Match Group CEO Mandy Ginsberg says she is flattered by Facebook&#8217;s entrance into its space.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re flattered that Facebook is coming into our space &#8211; and sees the global opportunity that we do &#8211; as <a class=\"crunchbase-link\" href=\"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/organization\/tinder\/\" target=\"_blank\" data-type=\"organization\" data-entity=\"tinder\">Tinder <span class=\"crunchbase-tooltip-indicator\"><\/span><\/a> continues to skyrocket,&#8221; Ginsberg said in a statement to TechCrunch. &#8220;We\u2019re surprised at the timing given the amount of personal and sensitive data that comes with this territory. Regardless, we\u2019re going to continue to delight our users through product innovation and relentless focus on relationship success. We understand this category better than anyone. Facebook\u2019s entry will only be invigorating to all of us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the parent company of Match threw some shade at Facebook. In a statement provided to TechCrunch, IAC CEO Joey Levin said,<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Come on in. The water\u2019s warm.

You&#8217;ll soon be able to post 3D photos to your news feed.

What&#8217;s most likely, though, is that Facebook will use some of its machine learning smarts to power some of this, especially given that the company also announced its (somewhat odd) <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2018\/05\/01\/facebooks-wants-weird-vr-memories-to-take-you-back-to-your-childhood\/\">3D memories<\/a> feature today, which uses machine learning to recreate the scenes of old photos in VR.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook already supports 360-degree photos and video in the news feed, so the addition of 3D photos makes perfect sense in this context.

Paul was drawn to robots from an early age because of the awe and wonder of watching your creation come to life in the real world and developed a deeper passion for the field when he recognized the empowerment that comes from creating something that can have real, tangible impact for good. In graduate school at UC Berkeley, Paul worked on how to design robots intelligently and wholistically such that the mechanisms, sensors, electronics, and software complement each other to create simple yet robust solutions to specific problems. This design mentality led to the technologies that launched Paul\u2019s first company, Dash Robotics, where he was a co-founder and CTO. Started during his Ph.D. and derived from his research, Dash Robotics focused on making low-cost, build-it-yourself, bio-inspired legged robots available to kids to promote STEM engagement. While moonlighting to help build and grow Dash Robotics, Paul was also a research engineer at SRI Robotics where he contributed to projects including lightweight wearable robotics, autonomous racing motorcycles, and dynamically-walking humanoid robots. Paul also helped push novel manipulator and arm designs at iRobot that are being used in products today. Of all the projects Paul takes on, he tries to keep his focus on making systems that are cutting-edge, yet practical and towards something deployable in a larger market.
